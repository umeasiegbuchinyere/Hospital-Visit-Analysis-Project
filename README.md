# Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient data to uncover key insights on treatment outcomes, cost drivers, and diagnosis trends. By examining factors such as age, gender,
insurance type, and admission method across hospital locations, the analysis aims to identify high-risk conditions, assess healthcare equity, and support data-driven decisions
for improving patient care and resource allocation.
