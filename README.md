# Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient data to uncover key insights on treatment outcomes, cost drivers, and diagnosis trends. By examining factors such as age, gender,
insurance type, and admission method across hospital locations, the analysis aims to identify high-risk conditions, assess healthcare equity, and support data-driven decisions
for improving patient care and resource allocation.

# Data Source
This dataset is a simulated hospital records dataset created for analytical and educational purposes. It mimics real-world healthcare data by including key fields such as 
patient demographics, diagnosis codes (ICD-10), admission types, treatment costs, and outcomes. While not drawn from a live healthcare system, it is structured to reflect common 
trends in hospital data for the purpose of exploring healthcare insights and decision-making.

# Problem Statement
Despite increasing healthcare access, hospitals face challenges in managing treatment outcomes, cost efficiency, and equitable care delivery. This dataset aims to explore how 
patient demographics, diagnoses, admission types, and insurance coverage influence treatment costs and health outcomesâ€”helping to identify gaps, high-risk conditions, and 
opportunities for improved hospital resource allocation and patient care.

# Tools used
- Excel

# Skills Demonstrated
The table was Formatted and Duplicate value were checked.

# Data Analysis
The following Pivot Chart were drew from the data
-	Diagnosis vs Outcome
-	Hospital Location vs Average Treatment cost
-	Admission type vs Outcome
-	Insurance type vs Average Treatment cost
-	Diagnosis vs Treatment cost
-	Age Group vs Outcome
-	Gender and Ethnicity vs Diagnosis

# Visualisations
A comprehensive dashboard was developed by assembling the pivot charts to allow for interactive insights into health.

Slicer Application: Slicers were added via Insert > Slicer, allowing dynamic filtering by fields such as
